Blackjack program in python

Just practicing my python skills. 

Program Details:

1.) Player receives two cards
2.) If cards are less than 21, player gets prompt to either hit or stand
3.) If cards are equal to 21, player wins
4.) If cards are more than 21, player loses

I plan to add more features such as:

1.) Player plays against CPU
2.) Possibly add a GUI. Tkinter? wxPyton?
3.) or possibly work with Pygame or Pyglet 

Anyway, this is a prototype and I can extend on this later.
